#### Current project status

    the project is still in progress because I need to optimize its performance, refactoring the code and writing the unit tests 

### Estimation of the outstanding work

    regarding the size of the work remaining, It would take me one more day to get it to a desired level

#### Successes
    I was able to finish the minimum required functionalities in time
#### Bumps
    Time was an issue

    so I would spend more time in understanding the problem description as it is the only solution to get this done in a very short time.

### How to run my solution

 - clone the repo and run `cd project directory`
 - `npm install` for backend installation and `cd front-end && yarn install` for front-end installation
 - Get back the root folder of the project, run this `cd ..`
 - Finally, Run this command `npm run start-all` and start testing the functionalities

### Technologies used
